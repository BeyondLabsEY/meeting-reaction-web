## How Meeting Reaction works
In the home screen, enter a meeting code (this code is alphanumeric and it has a length of exactly 6 characters). Every meeting has its own unique code.

Once the meeting code has been entered, you'll be able to visualize instant feedback data. You can either choose to view a word cloud or facial analysis.
